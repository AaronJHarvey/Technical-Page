                    Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

                    CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they're positioned relative to the following factors: their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, and the main viewport/window. The page layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module are:

            <section class="main-section" id="normal_flow">
                <header><h2>Normal Flow</h2></header>
                
                <p>Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout. Let's look at a quick HTML example:</p>
                   
                <code id="quick-html-code">
                    <p>I love my cat.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Buy cat food</li>
                        <li>Exercise</li>
                        <li>Cheer up friend</li>
                    </ul>
                        <p>The end!</p>
                </code>

                <p>By default, the browser will display this code as follows:</p>
                
                <div id="code-snippet-output">
                    <p>I love my cat.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Buy cat food</li>
                        <li>Exercise</li>
                        <li>Cheer up friend</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The end!</p>
                </div>

                <p>Note how the HTML is displayed in the exact order in which it appears in the source code, with elements stacked on top of one another — the first paragraph, followed by the unordered list, followed by the second paragraph.</p>

                <p>The elements that appear one below the other are described as block elements, in contrast to inline elements, which appear beside one another like the individual words in a paragraph.
                </p>
                    
                    <!-- Notecard div here:
                        Note: The direction in which block element contents are laid out is described as the Block Direction. The Block Direction runs vertically in a language such as English, which has a horizontal writing mode. It would run horizontally in any language with a Vertical Writing Mode, such as Japanese. The corresponding Inline Direction is the direction in which inline contents (such as a sentence) would run.
                    -->
                
                <p>For many of the elements on your page, the normal flow will create exactly the layout you need. However, for more complex layouts you will need to alter this default behavior using some of the tools available to you in CSS. Starting with a well-structured HTML document is very important because you can then work with the way things are laid out by default rather than fighting against it.</p>
                
                <p>The methods that can change how elements are laid out in CSS are:</p>
                    <!-- ul here with those methods here -->
                <ul class='layout-methods' id="layout-methods-list">
                    <li class='layout-method' id='method-one'> 
                        The display property — Standard values such as <code>block</code>, <code>inline</code>, or <code>inline-block</code> can change how elements behave in normal flow, for example, by making a block-level element behave like an inline-level element. We also have entire layout methods that are enabled via specific <code>display</code> values, for example, CSS Grid and Flexbox, which alter how child elements are laid out inside their parents.
                    </li>
                    <li class='layout-method' id="method-two">
                        Floats — Applying a <code>float</code> value such as <code>left</code> can cause block-level elements to wrap along one side of an element, like the way images sometimes have text floating around them in magazine layouts.
                    </li>
                    <li class='layout-method' id="method-three"> 
                        The position property — Allows you to precisely control the placement of boxes inside other boxes. <code>static</code> positioning is the default in normal flow, but you can cause elements to be laid out differently using other values, for example, as fixed to the top of the browser viewport.
                    </li>
                    <li class='layout-method' id="method-four"> 
                        Table layout — Features designed for styling parts of an HTML table can be used on non-table elements using <code>display:table</code> and associated properties.
                    </li>
                    <li class='layout-method' id="method-five">
                        Multi-column layout — The Multi-column layout properties can cause the content of a block to layout in columns, as you might see in a newspaper.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="the_display_property">
                <header><h2>The Display Property</h2></header>
                
                <p>
                    The main methods for achieving page layout in CSS all involve specifying values for the <code>display</code> property. This property allows us to change the default way something displays. Everything in normal flow has a default value for <code>display</code>; i.e., a default way that elements are set to behave. For example, the fact that paragraphs in English display one below the other is because they are styled with <code>display:block</code>. If you create a link around some text inside a paragraph, that link remains inline with the rest of the text, and doesn't break onto a new line. This is because the <code>a</code> element is <code>display:inline</code> by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can change this default display behavior. For example, the <code>li</code> element is <code>display:block</code> by default, meaning that list items display one below the other in our English document. If we were to change the display value to <code>inline</code> they would display next to each other, as words would do in a sentence. The fact that you can change the value of <code>display</code> for any element means that you can pick HTML elements for their semantic meaning without being concerned about how they will look. The way they look is something that you can change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to being able to change the default presentation by turning an item from <code>block</code> to <code>inline</code> and vice versa, there are some more involved layout methods that start out as a value of <code>display</code>. However, when using these you will generally need to invoke additional properties. The two values most important for our discussion of layout are <code>display:flex</code> and <code>display:grid</code>.
                </p>
            </section>






            <section class="main-section" id="flexbox">
                <header><h2>Flexbox</h2></header>
            
                <p>
                    Flexbox is the short name for the Flexible Box Layout CSS module, designed to make it easy for us to lay things out in one dimension — either as a row or as a column. To use flexbox, you apply <code>display:flex</code> to the parent element of the elements you want to lay out; all its direct children then become flex items. We can see this in a simple example.
                </p>

            
                <h3>Setting display: flex</h3>

                <p>
                    The HTML markup below gives us a containing element with a class of <code>wrapper</code>, inside of which are three <code>div</code> elements. By default these would display as block elements, that is, below one another in our English language document.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, if we add <code>display:flex</code> to the parent, the three items now arrange themselves into columns. This is due to them becoming flex items and being affected by some initial values that flexbox sets on the flex container. They are displayed in a row because the property <code>flex-direction</code> of the parent element has an initial value of <code>row</code>. They all appear to stretch in height because the property <code>align-items</code> of their parent element has an initial value of stretch. This means that the items <code>stretch</code> to the height of the flex container, which in this case is defined by the tallest item. The items all line up at the start of the container, leaving any extra space at the end of the row.
                </p>

                
                <h3>Setting the flex property</h3>
                
                
                <p>In addition to properties that can be applied to a <em>flex</em> container, there are also properties that can be applied to <em>flex</em> items. These properties, among other things, can change the way that items <em>flex</em>, enabling them to expand or contract according to available space.</p>
                
                <p>As a simple example, we can add the <code>flex</code> property to all of our child items, and give it a value of <code>1</code>. This will cause all of the items to grow and fill the container, rather than leaving space at the end. If there is more space then the items will become wider; if there is less space they will become narrower. In addition, if you add another element to the markup, the other items will all become smaller to make space for it; the items all together continue taking up all the space.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="grid_layout">
                <header><h2>Grid Layout</h2></header>
               
                <p>
                    While flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, Grid Layout is designed for two dimensions — lining things up in rows and columns.
                </p>

                <h3>Setting display:grid</h3>

                <p>
                    Similar to flexbox, we enable Grid Layout with its specific display value — <code>display:grid</code>. The below example uses similar markup to the flex example, with a container and some child elements. In addition to using <code>display: grid</code>, we also define some row and column tracks for the parent using the <code>grid-template-rows</code> and <code>grid-template-columns</code> properties respectively. We've defined three columns, each of <code>1fr</code>, as well as two rows of <code>100px</code>. We don't need to put any rules on the child elements; they're automatically placed into the cells our grid's created.
                </p>


                <h3>Placing items on the grid</h3>


                <p>
                    Once you have a grid, you can explicitly place your items on it, rather than relying on the auto-placement behavior. Setting the start and end line of each item using the <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code> properties causes the items in the grid to span multiple tracks. 
                </p>
